<h2>Release date of:</h2>

<h2>How Works?:</h2>

<p>According to sources close to Google, the glasses will have a small
    LCD or AMOLED screen at the top and in front of the user's eyes.
    With the use of a camera and GPS, you can position yourself, as well as select options
    with the movement of the head.</p>

<h2>What can you do with the Google Glasses?</h2>

<p>The publicity video from Google shows that you can become a kind of “super-<wbr/>human ”,
    since the device can indicate how many meters you are from your destination, whether the metro is open or closed,
    show the weather, schedule and even allow you to make appointments with just voice commands.</p>

<h2>Newness in the Glass:</h2>

<p>Google finally revealed the complete specifications for Google Glass,
      and with it a surprise still unprecedented in the market:
      the search giant will use an audio system based on conduction transduction.
      Through the glasses' stems, the sound will be transmitted to the user's ear by
      by means of microvibrations in certain bones of your head,
      without using any kind of speaker.</p>

<p>In addition to the audio surprise, the screen mounted in front of the user's eye also drew attention.
    It will be 640 x 360 pixels of resolution that, in proportion, would be equivalent to a 25 inch monitor
    high definition TV placed 2.5 meters away from the viewer..</p>
